Gave names + ccids

Set up wiki
Make tests

most of the marks are from docs, reqs, wiki
    these are usually 20% of the work
    80% is the app working

wiki requirements page for use cases

use case is example of someone using the app fulfilling the requirement

ex. app allows uploading photos:
    go through the steps a user takes to upload the photo

write test cases based on idea of what needs to be done

interface mockup:
    pictures of the views
    use drawing program
    every important screen that user will encounter w/ description

storyboard:
    transitions between views
    single image

glossary
    license
    doc all the sources
    use libraries :)

hardest part is intent testing
find good practices for android
